AWS provides a plethora of free courses, but we do not know how to access them. This post will explain how to obtain such free systems. Let's get started, shall we?

Navigate to the [AWS training] website.

Go to Sign In, and if you don't have an Amazon account, like me, choose "All Regions" and then Sign-In:

A new page will appear:

If you have a pre-existing account, sign in; otherwise, proceed to "Create your Amazon account."

•	Fill out the form above to set up your account.

•	Sign into AWS after you've established your account.

•	After you've logged in, Visit the Learning Library.

•	In the Learning Library, set the language filters to "English" or another language of your choice, and then click on Free Digital Training.

When you finish the [AWS course], you may get your certificate from the Courses page.
